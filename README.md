# Simple URL Checker

A command-line tool to fetch a URL and log the response status.

## Usage

1. Make sure you have Go installed.
2. Clone this repository: `git clone https://github.com/username/repo.git`
3. Navigate to the project directory: `cd project-name`
4. Run the tool with a URL and log path:
